## Projects

### Sales Data Analysis
This project analyses a real retail sales dataset to identify top-performing products, seasonal trends and regional performance. The notebook shows how to preprocess raw sales data, compute key metrics and visualise findings. See the [project folder](./Sales_Data_Analysis/) for the notebook and data.

### Customer Churn Prediction
Using a synthetic telecom churn dataset, this project builds a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving. It covers feature engineering, model training, evaluation and next steps for deployment. Visit the [project folder](./Customer_Churn_Prediction/) for details.

### Market Basket Analysis
This notebook performs associationâ€‘rule mining on transaction data to discover frequently purchased item combinations and generate recommendations for cross-selling. Access the [project folder](./Market_Basket_Analysis/) for the analysis and data.

### Financial Performance Dashboard
Aggregating sales data at a monthly level, this project produces an interactive dashboard that tracks revenue, expenses, gross and net profit over time. The visuals help stakeholders monitor financial health and trends. See the [project folder](./Financial_Performance_Dashboard/) for the notebook and supporting materials.

## Getting Started
To reproduce these analyses, clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python libraries used across the projects.
