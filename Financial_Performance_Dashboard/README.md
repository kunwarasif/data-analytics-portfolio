# Financial Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project develops an interactive dashboard to visualize and monitor a company's financial performance. The dashboard brings together key metrics—revenue, expenses, gross and net profit, and profit margins—to provide executives with real‑time insights into business health and trends.

## Data Source
The data used for this dashboard comes from financial statements such as the income statement and balance sheet. It includes monthly totals for revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses and other relevant line items, collected over several fiscal years.

## Analysis Steps
1. Aggregate and clean financial data from ERP systems or spreadsheets.
2. Compute key performance indicators (KPIs) including gross profit, operating profit, net profit and various margin ratios.
3. Design an intuitive dashboard layout with interactive charts (line charts for trends, bar charts for category comparisons) and filters for selecting time periods or business units.
4. Implement the dashboard using tools like Microsoft Power BI, Tableau or Python's Plotly/Dash, ensuring that data refreshes are automated.
5. Share the dashboard with stakeholders and iterate based on feedback.

## Tools Used
- Data processing: Python (pandas) or Excel.
- Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly/Dash for interactive dashboards.
- Version control: Git and GitHub for collaborative development.

## Results
The dashboard provides clear visibility into revenue growth, expense patterns and profitability over time. For example, users can quickly see which product lines contribute most to revenue and identify months where expenses spiked, allowing for more informed budgeting and strategic planning.

## Next Steps
Possible future enhancements include:
- Integrating predictive models to forecast revenue and expenses.
- Adding scenario analysis capabilities for “what‑if” budgeting.
- Connecting the dashboard to live financial systems for real‑time updates.
