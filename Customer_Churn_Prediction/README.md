# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project builds a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn for a subscription service. The objective is to understand churn drivers and enable targeted retention strategies.

## Data Source

Use a customer transaction and behavior dataset with features such as tenure, usage patterns, support tickets, payment history, and demographics. Replace with your own dataset details.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preparation** – Clean and preprocess features, encode categorical variables, and handle class imbalance.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Create new variables that capture customer engagement, loyalty, and service usage.
3. **Model Training** – Split data into training/testing sets and train algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. **Interpretation** – Identify key features contributing to churn risk.

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Optional: SHAP for model interpretability

## Results

Report model performance metrics and highlight significant churn drivers.

## Next Steps

Deploy the model to score new customers, and integrate with CRM for targeted retention campaigns.
